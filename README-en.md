# Kino-Ticket Web Application ðŸŽ¥

## Project Description
The Kino-Ticket application allows users to select cinema tickets, reserve seats, and complete payment processes through a modern web interface. The project is designed as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** and features a **modular** architecture for future scalability.

The platform is based on the **CineGrup** infrastructure. Currently, two cinemas are supported, but the modular structure allows for easy addition of cinemas, movies, and seating plans.
